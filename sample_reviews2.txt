name- Mike Jones
Review- Mike jones is a swell guy who works hard. He has a solid work ethic that gets the job done.
He has no problem doing the job that needs to get done. He goes above and beyond daily.
Sometimes he comes in 5 minutes late, but it doesn't seem to slow anything down. He stays later if things are not where they should be. I admire his dedication.

name- John Dough
Review- John Dough is a lazy guy who does the bare minimum. He has a tendency to sleep during meetings.
It is rare that his breath is pleasant. Sometimes he comes in early to use the showers in the gym. If John worked harder, maybe he would be able to solidify a future here. I feel his work unsatisfactory.
He should work from home.

name- Cathy Talker
Review- Cathy is a good person to have around. She works hard and tries her best to set a good example. She comes to work on time and never cries when she has to stay later. She shares her food at lunch.
Cathy could use some work in the graphics design area. Her graphics are not good, nor modern.
I wish she studied more typography.

name- Susan McMooth
Review- Susan cries at the office very frequently. She often leaves meetings early to cry.
Sometimes when watching Disney movies, she even gets angry and loud. She is not passionate about work.
I love the fact that she comes in early though, she always has to leave on time for those pesky children. I find her unsatisfactory overall, but her attitude is nice. She doesn't do a good job with her marketing.
